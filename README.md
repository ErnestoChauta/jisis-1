J-ISIS is a new multiplatform Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) that provides the same successful concepts and functionalities as the UNESCO worldwide known ISIS suite while removing the restrictions, being Client/Server, UNICODE, and benefiting of the latest software developments.
The initial project was started by UNESCO in 2008.The architecture and design of J-ISIS was conceived by UNESCO taking WinISIS as a reference for the functionality. The objective was to develop a modern, robust, elegant, flexible, and maintainable software that could replace WinISIS. The project was initially developed by developers from different countries (Azerbaijan, Italy, Belgium, etc) through fee contracts paid by UNESCO.
ISIS community is mainly users and there are very few peoples who have programming skills. That's one of the main problem to find contributors. On the other side, J-ISIS is a quite complex software application that needs a time consuming study of the ISIS functionality and J-ISIS code software before being able to be involved in the development.Basic knowledge of NetBeans RCP and modular approach is also needed.

J-ISIS has his own server Persistence Manager based on Oracle Berkeley DB Java Edition for storing records. It also includes a TCP/IP database server and http server (embedded Jetty), as well as an embedded Web Browser (JavaFX) to display records. Lucene is used for indexing database records, searching and suggestions. 
You can import data from external files recorded according to several standard format for information interchange such as ISO-2709, MARC21, UNIMARC, MarcXML, MODS and Dublin Core using different encoding schemes. These records can then be visualized, indexed for searching, edited, modified using batch processing, sorted and printed in HTML/PDF, etc.
You can export data stored in the Persistence Manager according to several standard format for information interchange such as ISO-2709, MARC21, UNIMARC, MarcXML, MODS and Dublin Core using different encoding schemes.
And much more...
